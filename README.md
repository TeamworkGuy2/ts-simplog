TypeScript Simple Log
==============

Sometimes you just want to log something, you want a simple static logging object with methods like log(), error(), and debug() and you want to customize how those messages are logged later. 
You want to write your own AJAX or HTML or localStorage output formatter for your logging. 
And you want the library to be small and easy to customize.

I can't guarantee this will fit everyone's needs, but take a look at the API and examples and decide for yourself.
